#The project should simulate the operation of a restaurant.
# When I run main.py it should start by randomly generating a quantity for each of the menu items in the restaurant.
# These quantities will have to go down when customers order the menu items.
# Each customer order can contain an Entree, Side, Wine, and a Dessert.
